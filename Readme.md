### # This Project is based on content-based systems
## Implementation of content-based systems


All data are first converted in to vector using "CountVectorizer."
After that by using cosine similarity the model has been train on  a data of 5000 movies. 
All the Movies name are available in "Movies_title.txt"

you just try it by you own :
##### 1) Clone the repo.

##### 2) start 'Movie Recomentation.py'

##### 3) open 'Movies_title.txt'

##### 4) just copy the name of a movies of whose similar movies you want then just paste it in 'Movie Recomentation.py' Input line

##### 5) Top 5 similar movies available in database will show up.
